   <h3> Description </h3>
   <p> The crab rangoon, a delicacy of the great chain of Panda Express, is my favorite dish. It is reminiscent of the Brazilian food "Pastel", which is a deep fried dough with different stuffings inside. A crab rangoon, despite its name, can be made without crab. Whatever mixture you decide to use, crab or crabless, the process is simple and the end result is mouth-watering. Just make sure to allow proper cool-down time! Your tastebuds will thank you.</p>
